# Shopping list web application ( Todo list app) 

To start using this app, clone then make sure to ``` init npm ``` in order to initialise it
After that install the necessary packages ``` npm i express body-parser ejs lodash mongoose ```
This web app uses mongoDB as local database, and mongoose for simplicity. Currently you can create lists in different categories and assign tasks to each list.
Routes for each category/list will be automatically generated. 

#### Currently working on adding the following features: 
1. weather sidebar 
2. daily motivational quotes (from an API)
